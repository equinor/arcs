## Installation
To install Arcs using the standard `pip` Python package manager, after having checked out this repository, use:

```
pip install .
```

Arcs uses the [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) package and dependency manager. For development and testing, install `poetry` (using `brew install poetry`, `pipx install poetry` or using your favourite package manager), then:

```
poetry install
```

Refer to the Poetry documentation for more information.
